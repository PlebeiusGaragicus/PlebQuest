Given the following narrative:

As you enter the bustling royal court of Prince Klum, you are greeted by the regal and wise ruler himself. The Prince approaches you with a kind smile, his piercing blue eyes shining with a sense of urgency.

"Greetings, brave adventurer," he says, extending a hand in friendship. "I have summoned you here today for a task of great importance. In the heart of the nearby Woods of Whispers, there dwells a powerful and mysterious Witch. This witch has created a potion of unparalleled magic, capable of granting wishes to those who possess it. However, she has gone missing, and her disappearance has left the kingdom in turmoil."

The Prince pauses, studying you intensely before continuing, "I charge you, brave adventurer, to find the Witch of the Woods and retrieve this potion. Bring it back to me, and I promise you will be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams. But be warned, the journey is treacherous and filled with danger. You must be cunning, quick-witted, and above all, brave." With that, the Prince nods and dismisses you, sending you off on your perilous quest.

As you stand before Prince Klum, your mind races with the weight of the task he has given you. The Witch of the Woods is said to be powerful and elusive, and the journey to find her will not be easy. You think of three possible actions to take to further your quest:

Firstly, you consider inquiring about the location of the Witch from the locals in the nearby village. You know that the villagers have a deep respect for the forest and its inhabitants, and they may hold valuable information about the Witch's whereabouts. However, you also know that the villagers are wary of outsiders, and you may need to tread carefully to gain their trust.

Secondly, you think about following the trail of clues left by the Witch herself. You have heard rumors of a path of breadcrumbs leading deep into the Woods of Whispers, and you wonder if this could be your best chance at finding her. The thought of tracking down the Witch through treacherous terrain fills you with determination, but you also know that the journey will be long and arduous.

Lastly, you consider seeking out the Prince's trusted advisor, a wise old man who has been by his side for many years. You have heard that this advisor holds great knowledge of the kingdom's history and politics, and he may be able to provide valuable insight into the Witch's whereabouts and motivations. However, you know that the advisor is known to be fiercely loyal to the Prince, and you wonder if he will be willing to share his knowledge with an outsider like yourself.
